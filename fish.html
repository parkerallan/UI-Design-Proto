      <h3>Fish</h3>
      <p>Fish have evolved to be a versatile animal seen in today's society through the use of being a pet, being fished for sport and being an essential animal in river, lake, and ocean ecosystems that the world depends on. The <a href="https://spca.bc.ca/news/fun-facts-about-fish/">SPCA says</a> that the wild adult salmon living in saltwater can travel up to 50 kilometers per day during the spawning season and a total of 3000 kilometers in the entire season, which is testament to this animal's uniqueness. There is many other things that make fish an attractive candidate to be a pet including its bright colors and unique features. Some people prefer to own tropical fish native to saltwater while others enjoy freshwater fish.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Keeping an aquarium in your home adds several health benefits including lowered blood pressure and reduced stress. Freshwater tanks tend to be easier to take care of than saltwater tanks, also making it more forgiving to possible mistakes by new owners. There is massive variety of different freshwater fish you can keep in your tank including fish like the Goldfish, Tetras, Guppies, Beta, and many many more at a usually affordable price compared to saltwater varieties. You'll have to be careful about what combination of fish you keep in your aquarium as some species can be overly aggressive or even predatory if they are in the tank with other fish. It is best to do as much research as you can on individual species so you know not only what their personality type is like, but what kind on enviromental factors they prefer to live in.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title"></h5>
        <p class="card-text">Owning saltwater fish can be a very rewarding experience for many but requires more upkeep and maintenance than freshwater fish. Factors such keeping the tank temperature controlled is paramount for tropical fish like the Clownfish, Angelfish, Butterflyfish, and Goby. Also maintaining the right salinity level of the water and replacing evaporated water can seem like a juggling act for new owners. Also adding live coral, anemone, and shrimp to your tank can make for a more immersive ocean experience but often times is met with a bigger price tag than that of a freshwater tank.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title"></h5>
        <p class="card-text">A large part of keeping your fish happy and healthy is ensuring that that their tank is clean. Regular maintenance is important to keeping all aquarium tanks a safe enviroment to live in. Knowing what maintenance to perform especially on bigger tanks can be a struggle for new owners. Making sure that filters remain unclogged and are running at full strength is a massive step ensuring things like waste, uneaten food, and other harmful byproducts do not accumulate in the water. Other daily maintenance such as observing to making sure lights or the heater are working properly or that water is topped off is important too.</p>
